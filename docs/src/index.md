## Introduction

Hecke is a software package for computational algebraic number theory. It is written in the julia programming language and makes use of the computer algebra packages [Nemo.jl](https://nemocas.github.io/Nemo.jl/latest/) and [AbstractAlgebra.jl](https://nemocas.github.io/AbstractAlgebra.jl/stable/).

Hecke is part of the [OSCAR](https://www.oscar-system.org) computer algebra system, which covers algebraic geometry, group theory, and polyhedral geometry in addition to number theory and commutative algebra.

## Features

Hecke currently provides functionliaty to enable a number of computations in number theory and commutative algebra. Some of the features implemented by Hecke include:

- Number fields (absolute, relative, simple and non-simple),
- Orders and ideals in number fields,
- Class and unit group computations of orders,
- Lattice enumeration,
- Sparse linear algebra,
- Class field theory,
- Abelian groups,
- Associative algebras,
- Ideals and orders in (semisimple) associative algebras,
- Locally free class groups of orders in semisimple algebras,
- Quadratic and Hermitian forms and lattices.
